# We need to calculate the size of a weapon's
# "attack area". With a 1.0 meter sword, for example,
# a player can attack in an area of 3.14 square meters
# around them. You can use the area_of_circle function
# to do that calculation.

# Fix the bug on line 13 by
# calling the area_of_circle function with the spear_length
# as input and store the result in the spear_area variable.

def area_of_circle(radius):
    pi = 3.14
    area = pi * radius * radius
    return area


sword_length = 1.0
spear_length = 2.0

# don't touch above this line

sword_area = area_of_circle(sword_length)
spear_area = area_of_circle(spear_length)

# don't touch below this line

print("Sword length:", sword_length, "meters.")
print("Sword attack area:", sword_area, "square meters")

print("Spear length:", spear_length, "meters.")
print("Spear attack area:", spear_area, "square meters")
