# Enough Discord talk, back to writing

# In Fantasy Quest, characters lose health due
#  to heat exhaustion. The game tracks the temperature
#  in Freedom units (Fahrenheit), but we need to display
#  the temperature in Celsius for players outside the
#  US. Here's the formula to calculate the temperature
#  in Celsius from Fahrenheit (f):

# 5/9 * (f - 32)

# Complete
#  the to_celsius function body. It should return the
#  temperature in Celsius for a given Fahrenheit temperature
#  (f parameter).                                    
# 
# 

def to_celsius(f):
    # ?
    c =  5 / 9 * (f - 32)
    return c

## Don't touch below this line


def test(f):
    c = round(to_celsius(f), 2)
    print(f, "degrees fahrenheit is", c, "degrees celsius")
