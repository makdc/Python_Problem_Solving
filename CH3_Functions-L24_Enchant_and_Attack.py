# Assignment
# 
# Complete the enchant_and_attack function.
#  It creates a new "enchanted" name for a weapon and
#  calculates how much damage the enchanted weapon will
#  deal to a targeted enemy.
# 
# It accepts 3 parameters:
# 
#     target_health: integer
#     damage: integer
#     weapon: string
# 
# It should do the following things in the function body:
# 

#  Calculate and store the "enchanted damage" in a new variable. The enchanted
#  damage should be the input damage plus 10.
#  Calculate and store the "new health" in a new variable. The new
#  health should be the input target_health minus the enchanted damage.
#  Create a new variable called enchanted_weapon. It should be the input weapon with
#  the string "enchanted " added to the beginning of it.

#  For example:
#         sword -> enchanted sword
#         axe -> enchanted axe
#  Return the enchanted weapon and the new health in that order.
# 

def enchant_and_attack(target_health, damage, weapon):

    new_health = target_health - enchanted_damage
    enchanted_weapon = f"enchanted {weapon}"
    return enchanted_weapon, new_health
